HELLO, this is a python and openCV project which identifies different colours in images.(865 colours)

Basically, colour is a 3 dimensional array(R,G,B) and each value can take a max. value of 255. This is the fundamental concept that I'll be working with.

I have included the csv file of the color names and codes along with the sample image.

Thank you and happy coding :)
